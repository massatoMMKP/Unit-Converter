# Temperature Unit Converter

## Description
This is a simple temperature unit converter written in Python. The program provides options to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It allows the user to choose the type of conversion, enter the temperature value, and get the converted result.

## How it Works
1. The user is prompted to select one of six conversions:
   - Celsius to Fahrenheit
   - Fahrenheit to Celsius
   - Celsius to Kelvin
   - Kelvin to Celsius
   - Fahrenheit to Kelvin
   - Kelvin to Fahrenheit
2. The user then inputs the temperature value in the chosen unit.
3. The program converts the temperature to the desired unit and displays the result.
4. The user can continue making conversions or exit the program.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Execution
To run the unit converter, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your computer.
2. Save the source code in a file named `unit_converter.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the `unit_converter.py` file is saved.
